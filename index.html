            <h3>The Famous Pilau Dish</h3>
            <p>
              A fragrant blend of long-grain rice slow-cooked with cardamom,
              cinnamon, cloves, and tender marinated beef. Inspired by the rich
              Swahili coast tradition, our pilau is served with fresh kachumbari
              and creamy coconut sauce for a perfectly balanced finish.

            <h3>Chef’s Special Tamarind Fish Curry</h3>
            <p>
              Fresh catch simmered gently in a velvety coconut curry infused
              with turmeric, coriander, garlic, and a hint of tamarind.
              Slow-cooked to perfection and served with fragrant rice or warm
              chapati for a deeply comforting coastal experience.

            <h3>Velvety Spiced Pumpkin Cream Soup</h3>
            <p>
              A silky blend of slow-roasted pumpkin, caramelized onions, and
              warm African spices, finished with a swirl of fresh cream. Smooth,
              comforting, and delicately balanced — the perfect start to your
              dining experience.
